# Anesthesia Log Simulator

A Python console + API application that calculates recommended anesthesia dosages based on patient data. Built with a focus on input validation, modular logic, and file handling. This project reflects my transition from a clinical anesthesiologist to a backend-focused software developer.

---

## Features

- Collects patient data via CLI (name, age, weight, ASA class)
- User chooses anesthesia type: Combined IV + Inhalational or Regional (Spinal/Epidural)
- Calculates drug dosages based on type and weight
- Adjusts dosages dynamically based on ASA class
- Recommends appropriate anesthesia protocol with clinical notes
- Logs session data to a `.csv` file with timestamp
- REST API endpoint for JSON input/output using Flask
- OOP-based design (inheritance, polymorphism, separation of concerns)
- Input validation with edge-case handling
- Fully unit tested (validation, calculations, logging)

---

## Planned Enhancements

Planned Improvements
- Add dosage warnings for pediatric and geriatric edge cases
- Add HTML form interface for direct web input
- Host public version on Render or Railway
- Add SQL backend for persistent case storage

---

## Technologies Used

- Python 3.12+
- Standard Library only (`datetime`, `csv`, `unittest`, etc.)
- Flask (for REST API)

##  How to Run (CLI)

1. Make sure you have Python 3 installed.
2. Clone the repository:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/katebabakova444/anesthesia_log_simulator.git
cd anesthesia_log_simulator
```

## Example output
Enter patient name: John Doe
Enter patient age: 45  
Enter patient weight (kg): 80  
Enter ASA class (I-V): [default: I]: II

Select anesthesia type:
1. Regional Anesthesia
2. Combined IV+Inhalational Anesthesia
- Enter number: 2

Recommended protocol:
Anesthesia Protocol: Combined IV + Inhalitional

ASA Class: II

**Induction**:
- **Propofol** 160 mg IV
- **Fentanyl** 120 mcg IV
- **Sevoflurane** 2-3% inspiring concentration

**Maintenance**:
- Monitor: SpO2, EtCO2, BP, HR
- **Note**: Dosages may require adjustment based on comorbidities and clinical status.

**Doses**:
- Propofol: 160 mg
- Fentanyl: 120 mcg
- Sevoflurane: 2-3% inspiring concentration

##  Notes

This app was created as a way to combine my medical background with new technical skills in backend development.
All logic is handled using Python classes and functions. Data is stored in human-readable format in a .csv file for easy access and auditing.
It was designed to showcase problem-solving, code structure, and the ability to evolve an idea from a CLI to a scalable API.
